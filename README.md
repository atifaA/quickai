# QuickAI

## QuickAI is a Python AI framework that makes it extremely easy to experiment with state-of-the-art Machine Learning models.

### Motivation

When I started to get into more advanced Machine Learning, I started to see how these famous neural network
architectures(such as EfficientNet), were doing amazing things. However, when I tried to implement these architectures
to problems that I wanted to solve, I realized that it was not super easy to implement and quickly experiment with these
architectures. That is where QuickAI came in. It allows for easy experimentation of many model architectures quickly.

### Dependencies:
Tensorflow, PyTorch, and Hugging face Transformers
